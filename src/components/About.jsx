      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Information Technology student with a strong focus on web development
        and building responsive, user-friendly applications. I enjoy working on both
        front-end and back-end development, creating systems that are functional,
        efficient, and visually clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical interests include modern web frameworks, database-driven
        applications, and API integration. I continuously improve my skills through
        academic work and personal projects, with the goal of becoming a professional
        web developer who delivers reliable and scalable web solutions.
